# Complete Guide: Using Bash on Windows with WSL2 + Ubuntu (From Zero to Pro)

This guide explains how to set up a **Linux Bash environment on Windows** using **WSL2 and Ubuntu**, starting from zero and ending with a professional developer-ready setup.  
It also covers **Python virtual environments** for clean development.

---

## 1. What Is WSL?

**WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows without dual boot or virtual machines.

### Why WSL2?
- Real Linux kernel
- Native Bash shell
- Better performance
- Docker & AI-ready
- Industry standard for developers

---

## 2. Install WSL (1 Command)

PowerShell → Run as Administrator
Paste this command:
```bash
wsl --install
```


**This will automatically:**
- Enable WSL
- Install Ubuntu
- Set WSL 2

Wait a little → The PC will restart

**If command Failed**

```markdown
wsl --install Downloading: Ubuntu Installing: Ubuntu WSL2 is not 
supported with your current machine configuration. Please enable the 
"Virtual Machine Platform" optional component and ensure virtualization 
is enabled in the BIOS. Enable "Virtual Machine Platform" by running: 
wsl.exe --install --no-distribution For information please visit 
https://aka.ms/enablevirtualization Error code:

```

## 3. Enable Virtualization (BIOS)

### For HP Envy (Intel Core i7)

1. Shut down the laptop
2. Power on and immediately press **ESC**
3. Press **F10** to enter BIOS
4. Go to:

System Configuration
→ Virtualization Technology

5. Set it to **Enabled**
6. Press **F10 → Save & Exit**

Virtualization: Enabled


---

## 4. Install WSL Core Components

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
wsl --install --no-distribution
```
Restart your system after this step.

## 5. Install Ubuntu on WSL

After restart, open PowerShell (Admin) and run:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Ubuntu will download and install automatically.

## 6. Ubuntu First-Time Setup

When Ubuntu opens:
- Create a username
- Create a password (input hidden)

You are now inside a Linux environment.

## 7. Verify Bash Installation

Run the following command inside Ubuntu:
```bash
bash --version
```

## 8. Access Windows Files from Bash

Windows drives are mounted under /mnt:

```bash
cd /mnt/c
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Desktop
```

This allows seamless Windows–Linux file sharing.

## 9. Basic Bash Commands (Must-Know)

These are the most important Bash commands every beginner should know when using Ubuntu on WSL.

---

### 1. `ls` – List Files and Folders

Shows all files and directories in the current location.

```bash
ls
ls -l      # detailed list
ls -a      # includes hidden files

```
### 2. `pwd` – Print Working Directory

Displays the full path of your current directory.
```bash
pwd
```
Example output:
```bash
/home/subhankaladi15
```

### 3. `cd` – Change Directory

Used to move between folders.

```
cd folder_name
```
Go back one level:
```
cd ..
```

Go to home directory:
```
cd ~
```

## 10. Beginner Practice Task

Try this mini exercise:
```bash
mkdir bash_practice
cd bash_practice
touch test.txt
echo "Bash is powerful" > test.txt
cat test.txt
pwd
ls
```

This confirms you understand the basics.
